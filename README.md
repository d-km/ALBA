# ALBA
ALBA: Apprenticeship Learning-Based Automaton for Generating Text via Inverse Reinforcement Learning.

## about ALBA
ALBA is a project for generating text from sampled corpus, via Inverse Reinforcement Learning.
For IRL method, I use Abbeel(2004)'s method(see below).
For RL method, I use Sarsa(Î»), in expectation of the learning of text as long trajectory.

## Usage
Writing this. See you soon!
